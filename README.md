# wakeUpDyno

**wakeUpDyno** is a tiny utility to prevent your Heroku dyno (server) from sleeping when not in use. 

According to [**herokuapp.com**, `If an app has a free web dyno, and that dyno receives no web traffic in a 30-minute period, it will sleep.`](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours) When a user loads a sleeping heroku app, it may take an uncomfortably long time (up to ten seconds!) for the dyno to spin up and serve the page. This is long enough for many users to assume the site is broken and move on. 

**wakeUpDyno** will perform a simple HTTP request to whatever url you provide, at regular intervals. If you use the url of your free dyno, that single GET request will be sufficient to prevent it from going dormant, so that visitors will not be made to endure unreasonably long loading times.

---

## Use
Import the default export from **wakeUpDyno** (a function) and invoke it after starting up your server. Pass in the url of your dyno as an argument:

```node
/* Example: as used with an Express app */

const express = require("express")
const wakeDyno = require("../wakeUpDyno");

// create an Express app
const app = express();

// start the server, then call wokeDyno(url).start()
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    wakeDyno(DYNO_URL); // DYNO_URL should be the url of your Heroku app
});

```
